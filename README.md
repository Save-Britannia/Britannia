# Pre-Felucca Ultima Online themed map for Unity

Tested in Unity 2019.4.16f1

Community map projects and base terrain scenes for Ultima games. Please contribute PRs!

Only individual file sizes under 100 MB. No paid assets or licenses that prevent source versions from being distributed may be included in pull requests if they are to be accepted. Only base map terrain scene data should be submitted presently, although please open an issue and we'd love to talk to you about other editors or ideas for maps and public Ultima-themed assets. Projects from any of Ultima's history are desired, although our initial contributions will be themed on the worlds of Ultima Online.

Only public assets, those whose license allows their re-distribution under the MIT license or with proper attribution if the license does allow for redistrobution, are permitted within this public repository. Supplying artwork and texture replacements for the base maps that you are the original author of is highly encouraged and we are happy to accept your help!

For now, we are focused on being a public resource for map data to get individuals and teams started on projects within the free Unity editor more quickly.
